Game rock, scissors, paper using HTML, CSS, Java script. The game keeps score, allows you to increase the number of games in the current round, reset the round and determine the winner of the round. In the game, the user plays against the computer. The computer makes moves in random order. The screen displays the progress of the computer and who won the current game.
The game uses three containers, HTML formatted in CSS. The game logic is controlled by a java script through the DOM and classes specified in HTML.
Further development can be by replacing random computer moves with strategies that take into account the statistics of user moves.
During the development we reference resources on the technologies used, as well as training materials on how to create this type of game:
